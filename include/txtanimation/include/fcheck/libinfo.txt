usage:

<-bool :> true if stream.is_open()
is_open(ifstream&, ofstream& :> main object
	char[], char*[] :> filename of file
	bool :> exit if filename is closed)
-checks ifstream object are he hold opened file


<-bool :> true if ifstream.good() == true 
ifstrm_status(ifstream& :> main object
	      char[], char*[] :> filename
	      bool :> exit if something wrong (dont reacting to eof)
	      bool :> return faslse if reached eof
	      bool :> slient (disable messages)) 
-checks ifstream objects for errors


<-bool :> if eof was reached
eof_msg(ifstream& :> main object
	char[], char*[] :> filename
	bool :> exit if eof was reached)
-prints eof warning

tip: you can change error preffix and error messages in messages/ directory. 
     example: messages/default.h, current.h -- file in use now
